// An explicit allowlist, not a denylist: the matcher below covers every
// route in either protected set, and any route added to Waves 2-4 that
// isn't listed here simply isn't matched at all - Next.js only runs
// this proxy on matched routes, so an unlisted route silently passes
// through with no gate. That's still a real gap (a route added later has
// to be added here too), but it's a narrower one than a single hand-rolled
// regex that has to positively identify every public path; this way, the
// two lists below are the only places "does this route need a session"
// is decided.
//
// /player-record itself (the Gatehouse login/register screen) is
// deliberately NOT in ADMIN or MEMBER prefixes below: it's where an
// unauthenticated visitor is supposed to land. Events and Tools are
// member-gated (full lock, including sub-pages) per a later decision to
// trade their public/SEO surface for members-only access; see the plan
// addendum for the reasoning. Guides was gated the same way and then
// reverted to public — see Addendum 2.
