    // particle placement, setState-in-effect for restoring saved tool
    // inputs, etc.) that predate this migration and aren't part of what a
    // Next 14->16 security upgrade requires fixing. Adopting React
    // Compiler readiness is a real, separate initiative that deserves its
    // own review pass, not a side effect of a dependency bump - so these
    // stay off for now, keeping the enforced lint bar the same as before
    // the upgrade.
